The ternary operator (also known as the conditional operator) in Java is a concise way to express a conditional statement. It is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

```java
variable = (condition) ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
```

Here's a simple example:

```java
public class TernaryOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        // Using the ternary operator to assign a value to a variable
        String result = (number > 0) ? "Positive" : "Non-positive";

        // Displaying the result
        System.out.println("The number is " + result);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- If the condition `(number > 0)` is true, the value "Positive" is assigned to the variable `result`.
- If the condition is false, the value "Non-positive" is assigned to the variable `result`.

You can use the ternary operator to make code more concise when the `if-else` statement is simple and involves only assigning values.

Here's a more complex example using the ternary operator within a print statement:

```java
public class ComplexTernaryOperatorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 15;
        int y = 20;

        // Using the ternary operator within a print statement
        System.out.println("The larger number is: " + ((x > y) ? x : y));
    }
}
```

In this example, the ternary operator is used within the print statement to directly output the larger number between `x` and `y`.

Keep in mind that while the ternary operator can make code more concise, it's essential to use it judiciously to maintain code readability. If the logic becomes too complex, it's often better to use a traditional `if-else` statement for clarity.
