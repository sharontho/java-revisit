# In Java, assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They combine the assignment (=) with another operation. 

## Here are some common assignment operators

### Simple Assignment (`=`)

```java
int x = 10;  // Assigns the value 10 to variable x
```

### Addition Assignment (`+=`)

```java
int y = 5;
y += 3;  // Equivalent to: y = y + 3;  // Adds 3 to the current value of y and assigns it back to y
```

### Subtraction Assignment (`-=`)

```java
int z = 8;
z -= 2;  // Equivalent to: z = z - 2;  // Subtracts 2 from the current value of z and assigns it back to z
```

### Multiplication Assignment (`*=`)

```java
int a = 4;
a *= 6;  // Equivalent to: a = a * 6;  // Multiplies the current value of a by 6 and assigns it back to a
```

### Division Assignment (`/=`)

```java
int b = 20;
b /= 4;  // Equivalent to: b = b / 4;  // Divides the current value of b by 4 and assigns it back to b
```

### Modulus Assignment (`%=`)

```java
int c = 15;
c %= 7;  // Equivalent to: c = c % 7;  // Computes the remainder when c is divided by 7 and assigns it back to c
```

### Note

- Assignment operators combine an operation with the assignment of the result to a variable.
- They are a shorthand way of expressing common operations.
