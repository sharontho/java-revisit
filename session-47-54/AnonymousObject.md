# In Java, an anonymous object is an object that is instantiated (created) without assigning it to a variable. It is often used for a short duration and is created for a one-time use. Anonymous objects are useful when you need to perform a quick operation without the need to store and reuse the object

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of anonymous objects:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int value;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Method to display the value
    public void displayValue() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous object without assigning it to a variable
        new MyClass(42).displayValue();

        // Another example with a different value
        new MyClass(100).displayValue();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We have a `MyClass` with a parameterized constructor and a method to display the value.
- In the `main` method, we create anonymous objects directly within the method call, without assigning them to variables.
- The anonymous objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor and its parameters.

Anonymous objects are beneficial when you need to perform a single operation and do not require the object afterward. They help to keep the code concise and are often used in scenarios where the object's lifecycle is short.

Keep in mind that anonymous objects are not reusable, and if you need to perform multiple operations with the same object, it's better to create a named object and reuse it.

```java
MyClass myObject = new MyClass(42);
myObject.displayValue();
```

In the above code, `myObject` is a named object that can be reused for multiple operations.

While anonymous objects can be handy, it's essential to use them judiciously and consider readability and maintainability when deciding whether to use named or anonymous objects.
