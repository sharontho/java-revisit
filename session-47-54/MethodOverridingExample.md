# Method overriding in Java is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already present in its superclass, it is said to override the method

Here's a simple example to demonstrate method overriding:

```java
// Superclass
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic sound");
    }
}

// Subclass overriding the makeSound method
class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

public class MethodOverridingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the subclass
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        // Call the overridden method
        myDog.makeSound(); // This will call the specific implementation in Dog
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` class has a method `makeSound` with a generic implementation.
- The `Dog` class extends `Animal` and provides a specific implementation for the `makeSound` method using the `@Override` annotation.

Key points about method overriding:

1. The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name, return type, and parameters) as the method in the superclass.
2. The `@Override` annotation is optional but recommended. It helps to catch errors if the method signature in the subclass doesn't match any method in the superclass.
3. The overridden method in the subclass should have the same or less restrictive access modifier than the method in the superclass. For example, if the superclass method is `protected`, the subclass method can be `protected` or `public`, but not `private`.

Method overriding is a crucial concept in achieving polymorphism in Java, allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. If you have any specific questions or if you'd like to explore more aspects of method overriding, feel free to ask!
