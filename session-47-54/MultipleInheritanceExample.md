# In Java, direct multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from more than one class) is not supported to avoid the "diamond problem," where ambiguity can arise when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. However, Java supports a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces

## Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces

In Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing it to inherit method signatures from several sources. This is a way to achieve multiple inheritance of behavior.

Here's an example:

```java
// First interface
interface Animal {
    void eat();
}

// Second interface
interface Mammal {
    void giveBirth();
}

// Concrete class implementing both interfaces
class Dog implements Animal, Mammal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating");
    }

    @Override
    public void giveBirth() {
        System.out.println("Dog gives birth to puppies");
    }

    // Additional method specific to Dog
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

public class MultipleInheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the class
        Dog myDog = new Dog();

        // Call methods from both interfaces and the class
        myDog.eat();         // Inherited from Animal interface
        myDog.giveBirth();   // Inherited from Mammal interface
        myDog.bark();        // Specific to Dog class
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` and `Mammal` interfaces define methods that classes implementing them must provide.
- The `Dog` class implements both interfaces and provides implementations for the `eat` and `giveBirth` methods.
- The `Dog` class also has an additional method `bark` specific to the class.

This way, a class in Java can inherit from multiple sources through interfaces, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance for behaviors.

It's important to note that while interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance for behaviors, they do not provide inheritance for fields (attributes or variables). Each class can have its own set of fields.
