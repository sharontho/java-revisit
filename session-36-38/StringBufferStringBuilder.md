# In Java, `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` are classes that provide mutable sequences of characters. They are similar in functionality, but there is a key difference between them: `StringBuffer` is thread-safe, whereas `StringBuilder` is not. Here's an overview of both classes

## StringBuffer

- `StringBuffer` is a part of Java's original set of classes for dealing with strings.
- It is designed to be thread-safe, meaning it can be safely used in a multi-threaded environment without external synchronization.
- Operations on `StringBuffer` are synchronized, which adds a level of overhead.
- Use `StringBuffer` when working in a multi-threaded environment or when thread safety is a concern.

Example using `StringBuffer`:

```java
StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("Hello");
stringBuffer.append(" World"); // Modifies the existing StringBuffer object
String result = stringBuffer.toString();
System.out.println(result); // Output: Hello World
```

## StringBuilder

- `StringBuilder` was introduced in Java 5 as part of the Java Collections Framework.
- It is similar to `StringBuffer` but lacks the synchronization overhead, making it more efficient in a single-threaded environment.
- Unlike `StringBuffer`, `StringBuilder` is not thread-safe. If used in a multi-threaded context, external synchronization should be applied.
- Use `StringBuilder` when working in a single-threaded environment or when you explicitly manage thread safety.

Example using `StringBuilder`:

```java
StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder("Hello");
stringBuilder.append(" World"); // Modifies the existing StringBuilder object
String result = stringBuilder.toString();
System.out.println(result); // Output: Hello World
```

## When to Use StringBuffer or StringBuilder

- If your code will be used in a single-threaded environment, prefer `StringBuilder` for its efficiency.
- If your code will be used in a multi-threaded environment, or if thread safety is required, use `StringBuffer`.
- When the benefits of mutability are needed (frequent string modifications), both `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` are useful.

In general, `StringBuilder` is more commonly used in modern Java programming due to its improved performance in single-threaded scenarios. However, when thread safety is a concern, or if working in a legacy or multi-threaded codebase, `StringBuffer` may be the appropriate choice.
