# In Java, strings can be classified into two categories based on their mutability: mutable and immutable

## Immutable Strings

- Strings in Java are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created.
- Once a string object is created, you cannot modify its content.
- Operations that seem to modify a string actually create a new string object.

Example of immutable string:

```java
String immutableStr = "Hello";
immutableStr = immutableStr.concat(", World!"); // Creates a new string
```

In this example, the `concat` method does not modify the original string (`immutableStr`), but it creates a new string with the concatenated content.

## Mutable Strings (StringBuilder and StringBuffer)

- If you need a mutable string in Java, you can use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` classes.
- These classes provide methods for modifying the contents of the string without creating new objects.

Example of mutable string using `StringBuilder`:

```java
StringBuilder mutableStr = new StringBuilder("Hello");
mutableStr.append(", World!"); // Modifies the existing StringBuilder object
```

In this example, the `append` method modifies the existing `StringBuilder` object without creating a new one.

## When to Use Immutable vs Mutable Strings

- **Immutable Strings:** Use immutable strings when the content doesn't change frequently, and you want the benefits of immutability (e.g., thread safety, security, and simplicity).

- **Mutable Strings (StringBuilder/Buffer):** Use mutable strings when you need to perform a lot of modifications to the content, and creating new string objects would be inefficient.

## String Pool and Immutability

- Immutable strings contribute to the efficiency of the string pool. Because strings are immutable, Java can reuse existing string objects in the string pool, reducing memory consumption and increasing performance.

In general, prefer using immutable strings for most scenarios due to their simplicity and thread safety. Use mutable strings (StringBuilder or StringBuffer) when you need to perform a lot of modifications to the string content in a more efficient manner.
