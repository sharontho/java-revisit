# Let's create an example that demonstrates the use of `this` keyword in a method and the `super` keyword in an overridden method

```java
// Parent class
class Animal {
    protected String sound;

    // Parameterized constructor
    public Animal(String sound) {
        this.sound = sound;
    }

    // Method to make the animal sound
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Generic animal sound: " + sound);
    }
}

// Child class extending the Parent class
class Cat extends Animal {
    private String breed;

    // Parameterized constructor for Cat
    public Cat(String sound, String breed) {
        // Call the constructor of the parent class using "super"
        super(sound);
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Override the makeSound method
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        // Use "super" to invoke the makeSound method from the parent class
        super.makeSound();
        System.out.println("Cat's special sound: Meow!");
    }

    // Method to display cat details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Breed: " + breed);
    }
}

public class ExampleWithThisAndSuper {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of the Cat class
        Cat myCat = new Cat("Purr", "Siamese");

        // Call methods on the Cat object
        myCat.displayDetails();
        myCat.makeSound();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` class has a `makeSound` method that prints a generic animal sound.
- The `Cat` class extends `Animal` and overrides the `makeSound` method. It uses `super.makeSound()` to invoke the `makeSound` method from the parent class before adding the cat's special sound.
- The `Cat` class has its own method `displayDetails` to show additional details specific to a cat.
- In the `main` method, we create an instance of the `Cat` class and call methods on it.

When you run this program, you'll see the output displaying both the generic animal sound and the cat's special sound.

Feel free to run this example and experiment with it. If you have any questions or if there's a specific concept you'd like to explore further, let me know!
