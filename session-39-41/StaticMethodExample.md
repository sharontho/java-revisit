# In Java, a static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. This means that you can call a static method on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. Static methods are declared using the `static` keyword

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of static methods:

```java
public class StaticMethodExample {

    // Static method
    static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }

    // Instance method
    void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an instance method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Call the static method without creating an instance
        StaticMethodExample.staticMethod();

        // Create an instance of the class
        StaticMethodExample obj = new StaticMethodExample();

        // Call the instance method using the instance
        obj.instanceMethod();
        
        // It is also possible to call a static method using an instance, but it is not recommended
        obj.staticMethod();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `staticMethod` is a static method that can be called without creating an instance of the class. It is invoked using the class name: `StaticMethodExample.staticMethod()`.

- `instanceMethod` is an instance method that belongs to each instance of the class. It is invoked using an instance of the class: `obj.instanceMethod()`.

- In the `main` method, we demonstrate calling the static method without creating an instance and calling the instance method using an instance of the class.

Key points:

- Static methods are associated with the class itself, not with instances of the class.

- Static methods can access only other static members (variables or methods) of the class. They cannot directly access instance variables or methods.

- They are often used for utility methods, where the behavior does not depend on the state of any particular instance.

- You can call a static method using the class name or an instance of the class, but it is recommended to use the class name for clarity.
