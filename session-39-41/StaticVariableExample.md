# In Java, a static variable (also known as a class variable) is a variable that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class. This means that there is only one copy of the static variable shared among all instances of the class. Static variables are declared using the `static` keyword.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of static variables:

```java
public class StaticVariableExample {

    // Static variable
    static int count = 0;

    // Instance variable
    int instanceCount;

    // Constructor
    public StaticVariableExample() {
        // Increment both the static variable and the instance variable
        count++;
        instanceCount++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create instances of the class
        StaticVariableExample obj1 = new StaticVariableExample();
        StaticVariableExample obj2 = new StaticVariableExample();
        StaticVariableExample obj3 = new StaticVariableExample();

        // Display the values of static and instance variables
        System.out.println("Static variable count: " + count);
        System.out.println("Instance variable of obj1: " + obj1.instanceCount);
        System.out.println("Instance variable of obj2: " + obj2.instanceCount);
        System.out.println("Instance variable of obj3: " + obj3.instanceCount);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `count` is a static variable shared among all instances of the class. It is incremented each time a new instance is created.
- `instanceCount` is an instance variable that belongs to each instance of the class. It is also incremented each time a new instance is created.
- The `main` method creates three instances of `StaticVariableExample`, and their respective instance and static variables are displayed.

When you run this program, you'll observe that the static variable `count` is shared among all instances, while each instance has its own copy of the instance variable `instanceCount`.

Static variables are often used to represent properties or behaviors that should be shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or counters. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
