# In Java, a static block is a block of code enclosed in curly braces `{}` and marked with the `static` keyword. This block of code is executed when the class is loaded into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is executed only once, regardless of how many instances of the class are created. Static blocks are mainly used for initializing static variables or performing any one-time initialization tasks for the class.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of a static block:

```java
public class StaticBlockExample {

    // Static variable
    static int count;

    // Static block
    static {
        System.out.println("This is a static block.");
        // Perform any one-time initialization tasks
        count = 100;
    }

    // Instance method
    void instanceMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is an instance method.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Access the static variable
        System.out.println("Static variable count: " + count);

        // Create an instance of the class
        StaticBlockExample obj = new StaticBlockExample();

        // Call the instance method
        obj.instanceMethod();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `static` block is defined using `static { /* code */ }`. In this block, we print a message and initialize the static variable `count` to 100.

- The `main` method demonstrates accessing the static variable and creating an instance of the class. Note that the static block is executed when the class is loaded, and its content is printed before the `main` method is called.

Static blocks are executed in the order they appear in the code, and they are executed only once when the class is loaded. They are useful for initializing static variables or performing any setup tasks that need to be done once for the entire class.
