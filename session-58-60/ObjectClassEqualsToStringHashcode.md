# In Java, the `Object` class is the root class for all classes, and it provides three important methods: `equals()`, `toString()`, and `hashCode()`. These methods have default implementations in the `Object` class, and they can be overridden by subclasses as needed

1. **`equals(Object obj)` Method:**
   - The `equals` method is used to compare the contents of two objects for equality. The default implementation in the `Object` class compares object references, meaning it checks if two references point to the exact same object in memory.
   - It's common for classes to override this method to provide a more meaningful comparison based on the content of the objects.
   - Example:

     ```java
     @Override
     public boolean equals(Object obj) {
         if (this == obj) {
             return true;  // Same object reference
         }
         if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) {
             return false; // Different classes or null object
         }
         // Compare fields for equality
         // ...
     }
     ```

2. **`toString()` Method:**
   - The `toString` method returns a string representation of the object. The default implementation in the `Object` class returns a string that consists of the class name followed by the "@" character and the object's hashcode.
   - It is common for classes to override this method to provide a more informative and human-readable string representation.
   - Example:

     ```java
     @Override
     public String toString() {
         return "MyClass{" +
                "field1=" + field1 +
                ", field2=" + field2 +
                '}';
     }
     ```

3. **`hashCode()` Method:**
   - The `hashCode` method returns a hashcode value for the object. The default implementation in the `Object` class returns the internal memory address of the object in integer form.
   - It is advisable to override this method in classes that override `equals` to ensure that equal objects have the same hashcode.
   - Example:

     ```java
     @Override
     public int hashCode() {
         int result = field1 != null ? field1.hashCode() : 0;
         result = 31 * result + (field2 != null ? field2.hashCode() : 0);
         return result;
     }
     ```

In summary, these methods play a crucial role in Java programming, especially when dealing with object comparisons, string representations, and hash-based data structures. It's common practice to override them in classes to provide more meaningful behavior based on the class's semantics.
